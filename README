How to compile:
Run the "make" command to compile the oss and worker to get oss and worker excutables

How to run:
To run the program, simply do "./oss" with any parameters. For example, ./oss -n 5 -s 5 -t 8 -f

How to open oss log:
Once you run the program, it will create an oss_log.txt file. You can open this text file separately, but from the command line,
you can do "cat oss_log.txt" and it will open the log within the terminal.



I scrapped my original program since it was too dysfunctional, and I rewrote this from scratch.
